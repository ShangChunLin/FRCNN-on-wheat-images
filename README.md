Implemtation of FRCNN (fast region-based convolutional neural networks) on wheat images

It was a kaggle competition. I mainly doing it for fun. 

The number beside red boxes are posisbilities of wheats

The training network in under folder NN, and the training/testing data is in my google drive (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f7O0mVL6w4R93rEIBTqIoXc30D4SJHBZ/view?usp=sharing)
